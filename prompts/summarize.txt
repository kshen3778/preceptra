You are generating a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) from multiple video transcripts of expert demonstrations.

Objective:
Generate a new SOP entirely from observed workflows in the transcripts. The goal is to create a ground-truth SOP that reflects what operators actually do, including tribal knowledge, undocumented checks, shortcuts, implicit sequencing, and decision rules.

Instructions:
1. Ignore any pre-existing SOP. Do not reference or modify prior documentation.
2. Parse all transcripts to infer the actual workflow used by operators.
3. Extract all observed steps and reconstruct the task into a clean, ordered SOP.
4. Identify tribal knowledge: hidden checks, undocumented adjustments, tacit reasoning.
5. Add steps that operators consistently perform but are not formally documented.
6. Include decision rules, branching logic, or safety/quality checks visible in the transcripts.
7. Format the SOP as clear, well-structured Markdown with headings, lists, and step-by-step instructions.
8. Include any important notes or observations in a separate notes field.
9. IMPORTANT: For each major step or instruction, cite the source video and approximate timestamp where that information came from. Include these citations inline in the markdown using the format: `(Source: [videoName] at ~[timestamp]s)`

Input:
You will receive a JSON array of transcript objects. Each transcript contains:
- audio_transcript: Array of speech segments with timestamps
- visual_description: Array of visual observations with timestamps (if available)
- task_summaries: High-level summaries of task segments (if available)
- videoName: Name of the source video

Output Format:
Return your response as well-formatted Markdown. Start with a main title using #, then include sections as needed.

If you have important observations, variations between operators, or tribal knowledge notes that don't fit in the main SOP, include them at the end in a section titled "## Notes" or "## Additional Observations".

Example format:

# Opening the Cash Register

## Overview
This procedure covers the standard process for opening and preparing the cash register at the start of a shift.

## Steps

### Step 1: Verify Cash Drawer
Count the starting cash to ensure it matches the expected amount. (Source: training_video_1.mp4 at ~45s)

### Step 2: Log Into System
Enter your employee ID and password into the POS terminal. (Source: training_video_2.mp4 at ~12s)

### Step 3: Check Receipt Paper
Verify that the receipt printer has adequate paper for the shift. (Source: training_video_1.mp4 at ~78s)

## Notes
Most operators check the receipt paper before logging in, even though the formal SOP says to do it after. Two operators mentioned always keeping extra receipt rolls under the counter.

Requirements:
- Use proper Markdown formatting: # for main title, ## for sections, ### for subsections, - or 1. for lists
- Include source citations inline using the format: (Source: [videoName] at ~[timestamp]s)
- Write naturally - no need to escape quotes or worry about JSON formatting
